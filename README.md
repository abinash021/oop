2. [Write a Java program to print the sum of two numbers.](https://github.com/basu021/oop/tree/main/oop_using_java/exp-2)

3. [Write a Java program that takes a number as input and prints its multiplication table upto 10.](https://github.com/basu021/oop/tree/main/oop_using_java/exp-3)

4. [Write a Java program to print the area and perimeter of a rectangle.](https://github.com/basu021/oop/blob/main/oop_using_java/exp-4/Print_area_and_perimeter_of_rect.java)

5. [Write a Java program to swap two variables.](https://github.com/basu021/oop/tree/main/oop_using_java/exp-5)

6. [Write a Java program to convert a decimal number to binary number.](https://github.com/basu021/oop/tree/main/oop_using_java/exp-6)

7. [Write a Java program to compare two numbers.](https://github.com/basu021/oop/tree/main/oop_using_java/exp-7)

8. [Write a Java program to count the letters, spaces, numbers and other characters of an input string.](https://github.com/basu021/oop/tree/main/oop_using_java/exp-8)

9. [Write a Java program to reverse a string.](https://github.com/basu021/oop/tree/main/oop_using_java/exp-9)

10. [Write a Java program to compute the sum of the digits of an integer.](https://github.com/basu021/oop/tree/main/oop_using_java/exp-10)

11. [Write a Java program to accept a number and check the number is even or not. Prints 1 if the number is even or 0 if the number is odd.](https://github.com/basu021/oop/blob/main/oop_using_java/exp-11)

12. [Write a Java program that accepts two integer values from the user and return the larger values. However if the two values are the same, return 0](https://github.com/basu021/oop/blob/main/oop_using_java/exp-12)

13. [Write a Java program to get the larger value between first and last element of an array (length 3) of integers .](https://github.com/basu021/oop/blob/main/oop_using_java/exp-13)

14. <p><a href="https://github.com/basu021/oop/blob/main/oop_using_java/exp-14">Design a class to represent a bank account. Include the following members :</a> 
  - Data members:
    - Name of the depositor
    - Account Number
    - Type of account
    - Balance amount in the account
  - Methods:
    - To assign initial values
    - To deposit an amount
    - To withdraw an amount
    - To display the name and balance
  </p>

15. [Given are two one-dimensional arrays, A and B which are sorted in ascending order. Write a program to merge them into a single sorted array C that contains every item from arrays A and B, in ascending order](https://github.com/basu021/oop/tree/main/oop_using_java/exp-15)
